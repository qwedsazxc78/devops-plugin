# Kustomize Resource Validation -- Auto-trigger Skill

Automatically activates when any `kustomization.yaml` file is edited.

## Activation

**Trigger:** Any file named `kustomization.yaml` inside a Kustomize module directory (any directory containing `base/` and `overlays/` structure) is created or edited.

**Scope:** This applies to both base and overlay `kustomization.yaml` files.

## Instructions

After the user edits a `kustomization.yaml`, perform these validations in order. Use the file system tools (Glob, Read) to verify references -- do not guess.

### 1. Resource Reference Validation

For every entry in the `resources:` list, verify the target exists:

- **Directory references** (e.g., `../../base`): Resolve the relative path from the `kustomization.yaml` location and confirm the directory exists and contains its own `kustomization.yaml`.
- **File references** (e.g., `gitlab-runner-secret.yaml`): Confirm the file exists in the same directory as the `kustomization.yaml`.

Report missing references as **FAIL**.

### 2. Patch Reference Validation

For every entry in the `patches:` list that uses a `path:` key, verify:

- The referenced YAML file exists relative to the `kustomization.yaml` directory.
- The file contains valid Kubernetes resource structure (must have `apiVersion`, `kind`, and `metadata` fields).

Report missing or malformed patches as **FAIL**.

### 3. Orphaned File Detection

List all `.yaml` files in the same directory as the `kustomization.yaml`, then check whether each file is referenced as a `resources` entry or a `patches` path entry.

**Exclude from orphan detection:**
- `kustomization.yaml` itself
- Files inside the `env/` subdirectory (used by secretGenerator)
- Files matching `*.env`

Report unreferenced files as **WARN** with the message:

> WARNING: `<filename>` exists in `<directory>/` but is not referenced in `kustomization.yaml`. It may be orphaned.

### 4. Cross-Environment Consistency

This check only applies when the edited file is in an overlay directory (e.g., `overlays/dev/kustomization.yaml`).

Discover sibling environments by listing subdirectories under the `overlays/` parent directory. Compare the `resources:` and `patches:` lists across all discovered sibling environments. Report differences as **WARN** -- not FAIL, since environment-specific resources are sometimes intentional.

Example warning format:

> WARNING: `overlays/dev/kustomization.yaml` includes patch `airflow-sa-patch.yaml` which is absent from `overlays/stg/` and `overlays/prd/`. Verify this is intentional.

### 5. Build Validation

Determine the Kustomize module from the file path (the nearest ancestor directory containing both `base/` and `overlays/`).

- **If the file is in an overlay directory:** Run `kustomize build` for that specific environment only.
- **If the file is in a base directory:** Discover all environments under `overlays/` and run `kustomize build` for each.

```bash
kustomize build <module>/overlays/<env>
```

Report build failures as **FAIL** with the error output.

### 6. SecretGenerator / ConfigMapGenerator Check

If `secretGenerator` or `configMapGenerator` entries exist in the edited file, verify:

1. All referenced `envs` file paths exist relative to the `kustomization.yaml` directory.
2. All referenced `files` paths exist relative to the `kustomization.yaml` directory.
3. Each generator entry specifies a `namespace`.
4. If the repo convention is to use `generatorOptions.disableNameSuffixHash: true`, check it is set. If missing, warn:

> WARNING: `generatorOptions.disableNameSuffixHash` is not set to `true`. Consider setting `disableNameSuffixHash: true` at the top level of kustomization.yaml to maintain consistent resource names.

**Kustomize module conventions to detect:**
- If the module uses `namePrefix` in overlays, verify `namePrefix` is set and matches the environment directory name (e.g., `dev-`, `stg-`, `prd-`).
- If sibling overlays do not use `namePrefix`, do not flag its absence.

## Output Format

Always show the validation summary table, regardless of whether issues are found.

```
Kustomize Validation: <path/to/kustomization.yaml>

| # | Check                  | Status | Details                              |
|---|------------------------|--------|--------------------------------------|
| 1 | Resources              | PASS   | 5 resources, 0 missing               |
| 2 | Patches                | PASS   | 3 patches, 0 missing                 |
| 3 | Orphaned Files         | WARN   | 1 orphaned: unused-config.yaml       |
| 4 | Cross-Env Consistency  | OK     | Consistent across all environments   |
| 5 | Build (<env>)          | PASS   | Build succeeded                      |
| 6 | Generators             | PASS   | 2 secretGenerators, all refs valid   |
```

If there are errors or warnings, list them after the table:

```
Errors:
- [#1 Resources] File `missing-secret.yaml` not found in overlays/dev/

Warnings:
- [#3 Orphaned] `unused-config.yaml` is not referenced in kustomization.yaml
- [#4 Cross-Env] Patch `extra-patch.yaml` exists only in dev overlay
```

If all checks pass with no warnings, end with: "All checks passed. No issues found."
